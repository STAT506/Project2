# Project2


## Project 2 Description

For the second project, the focus will be on linear regression. Note that the rubric has been adjusted from project 1. You are welcome to work individually or in a group of two.

The provided dataset comes from the Google Cloud & NCAA March Madness Analytics competition hosted on Kaggle. The data can be obtained at the following link: [https://www.kaggle.com/c/march-madness-analytics-2020/data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/march-madness-analytics-2020/data).

>> Your challenge is to tell a data story about college basketball through a combination of both narrative text and data exploration. A “story” could be defined any number of ways, and that’s deliberate. You are to deeply explore (through data) the mania of the Men’s and Women’s NCAA College Basketball tournaments. That story can be examined in the macro (for example: How does “competitiveness” differ from the regular season to their decisions in the tournament?) or the micro (for example: Does effectively neutralizing an opponent’s star players increase their ability to “stay in the game”?).

You can also choose a dataset to work with for the project.


## Project 2 Rubric

All items are graded with the following scheme, where some have multipliers:

1. __No Credit__: Criterion was not addressed or was written in a way that was not understandable.

2. __Beginning__:  Ideas are not clear and supporting ideas are not presented.

3. __Developing__: Ideas are identified but not well supported and developed or are minimally supported and developed.

4. __Advanced__: Ideas are clearly identified and are adequately supported and developed.
